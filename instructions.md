### Deploying an IPFS Cluster on Kubo Using Ansible and Terraform

#### Overview
This document provides guidance on deploying an IPFS cluster using Kubo (formerly go-ipfs) as the IPFS implementation. The goal is to automate both infrastructure provisioning and software configuration using Terraform (for Infrastructure as Code) and Ansible (for provisioning and configuration management).

---

### 1. Understanding the Requirements

#### IPFS Cluster:
- A distributed data storage system where nodes collaboratively manage and replicate content.
- Kubo is an implementation of the IPFS protocol that you will use to run the IPFS nodes.

#### Infrastructure and Configuration Automation:
- **Terraform**: For describing and provisioning the underlying infrastructure (virtual machines, networking, security groups, etc.).
- **Ansible**: For configuring software (Kubo/IPFS), setting up services, and managing the nodes after they are provisioned.

---

### 2. Prerequisites

#### Terraform Setup:
- Install Terraform on your local machine: [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).
- Obtain and configure API credentials for your chosen cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create resources such as VMs, networks, and security groups.

#### Ansible Setup:
- Install Ansible, for example, on Ubuntu/Debian:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ansible
  ```
- Prepare an Ansible inventory file that lists the target hosts (the nodes that will form the IPFS cluster).
- Ensure SSH access to the target hosts (configure SSH keys, verify public IPs, or set up a VPN if needed).

#### Kubo (IPFS) Setup:
- Download or prepare the Kubo (go-ipfs) binaries from the official repository or IPFS distributions.
- Make sure that the `ipfs` binary will be available on all nodes. You can use Ansible’s `get_url` or `copy` modules to distribute the binary or run a command to download it on each node.

---

### 3. Provisioning Infrastructure with Terraform

#### Create a Terraform Configuration:

Create a `main.tf` file defining your resources. For example, on AWS:
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "ipfs_nodes" {
  count         = 3
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
  instance_type = "t2.medium"

  # Customize security groups, SSH keys, and other parameters as needed

  tags = {
    Name = "IPFS_Node_${count.index}"
  }
}

output "ipfs_nodes_public_ips" {
  value = aws_instance.ipfs_nodes.*.public_ip
}
```
Adjust the parameters as needed (AMI, instance type, region, provider).

#### Run Terraform:

1. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
2. Review and apply the plan:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```
After a successful apply, Terraform will output the public IP addresses of the created instances. Use these IPs in your Ansible inventory.

---

### 4. Configuring the IPFS Cluster with Ansible

#### Create an Ansible Playbook:

Create a `playbook.yml` to install and configure Kubo and IPFS cluster services:
```yaml
---
- name: Configure IPFS Cluster
  hosts: ipfs_nodes
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install IPFS Kubo binary
      get_url:
        url: "https://dist.ipfs.tech/kubo/latest/kubo_linux-amd64"
        dest: "/usr/local/bin/ipfs"
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Initialize IPFS repository
      command: ipfs init

    - name: Start IPFS daemon
      command: nohup ipfs daemon &

    - name: Install IPFS Cluster service binary
      get_url:
        url: "https://dist.ipfs.tech/ipfs-cluster-service/latest/ipfs-cluster-service_linux-amd64"
        dest: "/usr/local/bin/ipfs-cluster-service"
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Initialize IPFS Cluster Service
      command: ipfs-cluster-service init

    - name: Start IPFS Cluster daemon (bootstrap one node or join others)
      command: ipfs-cluster-service daemon --bootstrap /ip4/BOOTSTRAP_NODE_IP/tcp/9096/ipfs/BOOTSTRAP_PEER_ID
```
Replace `BOOTSTRAP_NODE_IP` and `BOOTSTRAP_PEER_ID` with the appropriate values from your chosen bootstrap node.

#### Ansible Inventory:
Create or update `inventory.ini`:
```ini
[ipfs_nodes]
192.168.1.100
192.168.1.101
192.168.1.102
```
Substitute these IP addresses with the ones you obtained from Terraform.

#### Run the Playbook:
Run:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
```
This will install IPFS on all nodes, initialize them, and configure them to form a cluster. Make sure to specify correct bootstrap parameters if needed.

---

### 5. Testing the Cluster

#### Check Connectivity:
On one of the nodes:
```bash
ipfs swarm peers
```
You should see peer addresses of other nodes.

#### Add a File:
```bash
ipfs add testfile.txt
```
Note the resulting hash of the file.

#### Retrieve the File from Another Node:
On a different node:
```bash
ipfs cat <FILE_HASH>
```
You should see the file’s contents, confirming that the cluster is working.

---

### Requirements Recap:
- Terraform installed and configured with your cloud provider credentials.
- Ansible installed on the control machine.
- Access to Kubo binaries or a method to download them on the target nodes.
- Basic understanding of network configuration, firewalls, and security groups.
